AstronGo
--------------
_A Server Technology for Realtime Object Networking in GoLang_

AstronGo is a rewrite of Astron, an open-source, distributed server suite particularly well suited
for powering MMO games written in C++. Inspired by major issues with Astron, especially stability and diagnostics, it has been completely 
rewritten in GoLang which provides built-in support for networking and concurrency as a language.

## Roadmap

As of January 2020, the foundation of AstronGo is complete. This includes core components such as
the DClass system, the message director, and their associated unit testing. There are no exact deadlines
for development milestones, however, this is a basic in-order list of components to be written.
1) Eventlogger
2) ClientAgent
    - Configuration Implementation and Testing
    - Haproxy Implementation
3) Client
    - Research and Development
    - Architecture Redesign and Implementation
4) Unit Testing
5) StateServer
6) Database


## Contributing

This project is currently dormant as I am working full-time on [AutoML](https://modela.ai). I will probably complete the
development of AstronGO when I have more free time to work on passion projects.
