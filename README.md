AstronGo
--------------
_A Server Technology for Realtime Object Networking in GoLang_

AstronGo is an implementation of Astron, an open-source, distributed server protocol particularly well suited
for powering MMO games. Inspired by major issues with its C++ counterpart, such as performance and diagonstic capabilities, AstronGo reimplements the Astron protocol in GoLang, fully utilizing its built-in support for networking and concurrency.

## Roadmap

As of March 2020, the majority of AstronGo is complete. The State Server is fully unit tested and client development is underway. As a result of the ongoing Coronavirus crisis, development has been expedited and the project may reach a functional state very soon.
